This repository builds upon the following works:

Token-wise Influential Training Data Retrieval for Large Language Models by Huawei Lin, Jikai Long, Zhaozhuo Xu, and Weijie Zhao (arXiv:2405.11724v1) https://github.com/huawei-lin/RapidIn.git
Adapting and Evaluating Influence-Estimation Methods for Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees by Jonathan Brophy, Zayd Hammoudeh, and Daniel Lowd (arXiv:2205.00359) https://github.com/jjbrophy47/tree_influence.git


In this repository, I have integrated the BoostIn influence estimation code with RapidInâ€™s caching, compression, and parallel computing processes. This integration involved modifying the engine.py and boostin.py files to merge the functionalities of both models.
